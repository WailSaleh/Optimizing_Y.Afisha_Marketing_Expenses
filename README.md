# Optimizing Y.Afisha Marketing Expenses ðŸ“¢ðŸ’°

I did very well in the TripleTen course and received an internship offer in the analytical department of Y.Afisha. The first task is to help the company optimize its marketing expenses.

We have:

- Server logs with data on Y.Afisha accesses from January 2017 to December 2018

- A dump file with all orders made during the period

- Marketing expense statistics

Will analyze:

- How people use the product

- When they start buying

- How much revenue each customer generates for the company

- When the expenses will be covered
